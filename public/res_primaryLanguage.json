      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mathew Torres. I am a Software Developer.  Before I made the transition to software development, I spent my career working in sales and marketing, entrepreneurship and leadership in the US Army.  I have a passion for helping others, and a strong desire to build things that help improve the world. I decided to learn software development so that I can help turn visions into a reality. I feel software development is going to be an in demand skill set for the foreseeable future and I want to position myself to be the most marketable. I want to gain experience by working with startups who want to make the world a better place. I want to be the person who translates their vision into a tangible and functional application. I have spent years building soft skills from my past experiences. As I advance in this field, I feel these skills will help bridge the communication gap between tech and non-tech stakeholders.",
